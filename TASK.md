## Task Management Process

To add a new completed task:
1. Add it to the "Recently Completed" section in TASK.md with the date
2. When updating COMPLETED.md, append the new tasks to the appropriate section
3. No need to recreate the entire list of completed tasks

This approach saves time and keeps the task list manageable while maintaining a complete history of accomplishments.
